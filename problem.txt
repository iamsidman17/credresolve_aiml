Overview
1. Business Problem
CredResolve has thousands of borrowers who want to settle their debts but cannot pay the full amount. We have a complex Settlement Policy (stored in PDF/Markdown) that dictates how much discount we can offer based on:

Risk
DPD (Days Past Due)
Loan Type
Human agents struggle to memorize these rules, which leads to:

Revenue loss (if too much discount is offered)
Failed recoveries (if too strict with policy)
Challenge
Build a LangGraph-based Settlement Agent that functions like a virtual Settlement Officer. The agent must:

Read the borrower conversation from Live Chat.
Perform RAG to retrieve the correct policy clause for that borrower profile.
Calculate the strictly allowed counter-offer.
Generate the appropriate response.

Description
2. Problem Statement
Your task is to build a Negotiation Agent that processes a borrower's plea (e.g.,

"I lost my job and can only pay ₹20k"

and determines the Strictly Optimal Counter-Offer based on CredResolve's Settlement Policy.

The challenge is that the logic is distributed across two data sources:

Structured Data

Borrower's loan details:
Principal
DPD (Days Past Due)
Loan Type
Unstructured Policy

A 50-page PDF/Markdown document containing complex conditional rules.
Example rule:
> "If DPD > 90 and Loan Type is Personal, max waiver is 35%."
Your Agent must reason across both sources to determine the Floor Price:

Floor Price = Minimum Acceptable Offer as per CredResolve's Settlement Policy.

Evaluation
3. Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between your predicted min_acceptable_offer and the Ground Truth calculated by our expert auditors.


Where:

( y_{{true}} ): The strictly correct settlement amount derived from the policy.
( y_{pred}} ): The amount your Agent proposed.
Penalty Logic
If your agent is too generous (e.g., hallucinates a 90% discount), the MAE will be large.
If your agent is too stingy (e.g., ignores the "Medical Emergency" clause), the MAE will also be high.
The winner is the Agent that follows the policy as closely and strictly as possible.

4. Submission Format
You must submit a CSV file with a header containing two columns:

scenario_id
min_acceptable_offer
Example
```csv scenario_id,min_acceptable_offer…
SCN_0,45000…
SCN_1,12500…
SCN_2,80000…
